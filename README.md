# NetSeeker
`netseeker` is a Python-based toolkit designed for network analysis, reconnaissance, and footprinting. Instead of relying on existing alternatives like Nmap, the goal is to build tools (e.g. a port scanner) from the ground up using network-based Python libraries such as Scapy and Socket.
